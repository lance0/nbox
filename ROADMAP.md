# Roadmap

nbox is a **read-only** NetBox CLI, TUI, and MCP server. The near-term goal is the **best
possible read experience** — fast, correct, and pleasant both in the terminal and to agents.
Write support is a deliberate *later* track (see [Writes — deferred](#writes--deferred-later-track));
it lands only once the read tool is proven in practice.

Legend: ☐ planned · ◐ in progress · ☑ done

## Principles

- **Read-only is the product (for now).** Reads ship and get polished before any write surface.
  When writes come they'll be `PATCH`-based, minimal-diff, before/after-previewed, confirmable,
  and opt-in — never the default.
- **Agent-first.** CLI, TUI, and `nbox serve` (MCP) run off one command core; `--json`/`--envelope`/
  `--fields`/`--raw` + `AGENTS.md` make every read scriptable, and the same views back the MCP tools.
- **Correctness over breadth.** Typed errors, real-NetBox integration CI, and ambiguity surfaced
  (never silently guessed) before more surface area.

---

## Shipped — the read-only product

The read surface is broad and stable today (full history in `CHANGELOG.md`):

- **CLI lookups — 19 object types:** `device`, `interface`, `ip`, `prefix`, `vlan`, `site`, `rack`,
  `circuit`, `provider`, `aggregate`, `asn`, `ip-range`, `tenant`, `contact`, `vm`, `cluster`, plus
  `search`, `journal`, `tags`, `status`, `open`, `raw GET`. NetBox 4.2+ polymorphic scope + VRF
  correctness; ambiguous refs exit `5` with the candidate list.
- **Search:** parallel multi-endpoint fan-out with `--status` / `--site` / `--region` /
  `--site-group` / `--location` / `--tenant` / `--role` / `--tag` / `--vrf` filters (per-endpoint
  allowlist, resolved to ids); fail-closed with `--partial` for best-effort.
- **IPAM read:** `next-ip` / `next-prefix` (available, VRF-scoped), prefix utilization, cable/interface
  trace, VRF-scoped child prefixes + contained IPs.
- **Output:** `-o plain|json|csv`, `--raw`, `--envelope`, `--fields`, `--cols`; stable exit codes.
- **MCP server (`nbox serve`):** stdio **and** HTTP (Streamable HTTP), OAuth 2.1 OIDC resource-server
  mode (RFC 9728 metadata, audit log, per-caller rate limit), 8 read tools + a `nbox://{kind}/{ref}`
  resource template (DESIGN §24; read-only Pattern 3).
- **TUI:** list/preview split with focus, scrolling + position cues, 11 themes, command palette,
  fuzzy filter, recents, auto-refresh, device tabs, open-in-browser/copy, profile switcher
  (`P`/`Ctrl+P`), and an in-app **Config modal** (`S`) — profile editor (add/edit/select/delete),
  settings, and **first-run onboarding**.
- **Secrets:** OS keyring token storage with env fallback (`token_env` → `NBOX_TOKEN` → keyring);
  the token is never written to `config.toml` or logs.
- **Distribution & quality:** release matrix (musl + darwin + windows), Homebrew tap, GHCR image,
  shell completions + the full man-page set, crates.io; real-NetBox integration CI; whole-project
  `clippy::pedantic` gate. The detailed v0.1 / v0.1.1 records are kept below.

## Now — best-in-class read-only UX (current focus)

Polish the read experience. No writes here.

- ☑ **TUI search filters** — surface the CLI's `--status` / `--site` / scope / `--vrf` filters in the
  TUI (filter chips + palette + `f` modal) so the TUI is as capable a search as the CLI.
- ☑ **Dashboard / overview home** — a landing screen: counts by status, top-utilized prefixes, recent
  journal/changelog activity.
- ☑ **Hierarchical prefix tree** — expand/collapse children with inline utilization (netbox#21396/#21255).
- ☑ **TUI context preservation** — scroll position + active filters retained per view across navigation.
- ☑ **Profile cycle order** — cycle profiles in config-file order (an order-preserving map) rather than
  alphabetical.
- ☐ **Cross-object navigation** — jump between related objects from a detail (device↔IP↔prefix↔VLAN↔site,
  device→rack) without re-searching; an object-level back-stack to walk the drill path. Lands TUI-open +
  cross-nav for racks (see *full rack integration* below).
- ☐ **Demo recording** — an asciinema/VHS cast for the README.
- ☑ **Release `0.2.0`** — banked the large read surface accumulated since `0.1.1` (MCP HTTP/OAuth, the new
  read commands, MCP resources, the in-app config layer, three hardening rounds).

---

## Foundation before scale

These are the highest-leverage engineering items before the repo grows much more. Bias toward small,
reviewable PRs that lock contracts and reduce future change cost.

- ☑ **Golden JSON contracts, first slice** — file-backed contracts for `status`, `search`, and
  `device_detail`, rendered through the shared JSON renderer.
- ☑ **Shared test support layer** — `tests/support/` builders/helpers for representative fixtures,
  rendered JSON assertions, binary execution, and wiremock NetBox pages.
- ☑ **Binary error contracts, first slice** — process-level tests for exit codes `1`/`2`/`3`/`4`/`5`,
  clean stdout on errors, and actionable stderr.
- ☐ **Broaden output goldens** — add contract fixtures for `ip`, `prefix`, `vlan`, `interface`,
  `site`, and one journal-bearing detail response. This is the next best guardrail for agents and
  scripts.
- ☐ **CSV/output-mode contracts** — pin CSV shape for list/search output, `--cols` ordering, empty
  arrays, and the intentional “single objects are not CSV” usage error.
- ☐ **MCP response contracts** — stable JSON shapes for `nbox_status`, `nbox_search`, `nbox_get`,
  resource reads, and MCP error mapping (`invalid_params` vs internal errors). Keep these against
  direct server calls, not brittle protocol snapshots.
- ☐ **Fixture migration pass** — move repeated inline NetBox JSON in `search_tests`, `query_tests`,
  `scope_tests`, MCP tests, and custom-field tests onto `tests/support` builders as those files are
  next touched.
- ☐ **Compatibility matrix as tests + docs** — explicit NetBox 4.2 / 4.3 / 4.5 assumptions for REST
  scope behavior, GraphQL pagination/filter shapes, and supported object coverage. Keep the matrix
  backed by wiremock and the live integration lanes.
- ☐ **CLI contract harness** — a thin reusable harness for command-level tests that records
  `(args, stdout, stderr, exit_code)` expectations while preserving the stdout-data-only invariant.
- ☐ **Release smoke checklist automation** — one local command/script that runs the release-critical
  gate (`fmt`, diff check, both clippies, both test modes, audit, package/build smoke, man/completion
  generation) before tags move.
- ☐ **Observability contracts** — pin `nbox status`, MCP status, and selected debug/audit fields so
  users and agents can tell backend, version, capability, and failure mode without scraping prose.
- ☐ **Config migration/compat tests** — table-driven fixtures for old/current/future `config.toml`
  shapes, token-source precedence, redaction, and format-preserving edits.
- ☐ **Dependency and feature matrix** — CI or scripted local checks for default, `--no-default-features`,
  `http`, `keyring`, `keyring-secret-service`, and release-musl-relevant feature combinations.
- ☐ **Performance baseline, narrow** — bench or measured smoke for search fan-out and JSON rendering
  on representative fixture sizes. Do not add a cache unless measurements justify it.

## Writes — deferred (later track)

Writes are intentionally **not** near-term. They land after the read tool is proven in practice, behind
explicit opt-in (a write profile / `--allow-writes`, with `confirm_writes` already groundwork),
`PATCH`-based with a before/after diff + confirmation, and read-only staying the default everywhere.
Consolidated future scope:

- ☐ **Safe `PATCH` engine** — minimal diff, before/after preview, confirmation modal; agent-safe
  read-only default. Settle write rules first (choice fields `{value,label}`→string, brief relations
  by slug/id/name, confirmation semantics in non-TTY / `--json` / MCP).
- ☐ `nbox device <name> set status <value>` · `nbox interface <device> <iface> set description "…"` ·
  `nbox ip <addr> reserve --description "…"` · `nbox tag add <type> <name> <tag>`.
- ☐ **IPAM allocate** — claim the next IP/prefix, plus IP-range `available-ips` (POST to
  `available-ips` / `available-prefixes`); the read half (`next-ip` / `next-prefix`, range lookup)
  already ships.
- ☐ `changelog_message` support on writes.
- ☐ **Write-capable MCP tools** — opt-in, return the diff for the agent to confirm; read-only stays the
  default — plus the **per-user credential vault (Pattern 2)** for real per-user NetBox RBAC over MCP.
- ☐ TUI edit mode (`e` / `d` / confirm).
- ☐ `nbox raw POST|PATCH|DELETE`; OPTIONS write-capability discovery (optional `schema` command; would
  also enable value-level filter validation beyond today's typed allowlist, netbox#6489).
- ☐ **Agent write ergonomics** — a `--dry-run` convention and per-command skill files, landing with
  writes (`AGENTS.md` is the read-side foundation today).

---

## Later / under consideration

- ☑ **Full rack integration** — racks are now a first-class **searchable** `ObjectKind`: they appear in
  the global search fan-out (REST + GraphQL), `/` + `nbox search`, MCP `nbox_search`, and a `rack`
  palette lookup, honoring the site/region/site-group/location scope (like devices, via `*_id`). They
  were already openable + a cross-nav target in the TUI (`nbox rack <ref>`, device→rack). ☑ **Rack
  elevation** — the rack detail has an `e` (elevation) tab: a framed, U-by-U front view from NetBox's
  `/elevation/` endpoint (devices fill their U span, name on the top row), with rack-assigned-but-
  unpositioned devices listed below. ☐ Optional: rear face + a CLI `--elevation`.
- ☐ Multi-pane TUI refinement (nav | results | detail) per the DESIGN mockup, building on the current
  list/preview split.
- ☐ VRF-pivoted navigation in the TUI (a dedicated VRF view) — the `--vrf` filter, VRF-scoped prefix
  sections, and exact VRF-by-RD lookup already ship; this is the navigation layer on top.
- ☐ GraphQL detail views after the TUI detail experience settles — start with device detail as a
  read-only GraphQL query alternative to the REST fan-out; only pursue if the fan-out becomes a
  latency problem, and don't build both surfaces indefinitely.
- ☐ GraphQL backend cleanup once PR #11 has review miles: table-driven search descriptors for the
  repeated search branches, shared kind→web-path mapping, and less boilerplate around row IDs.
- ☐ GraphQL capability probing v2 if schema churn demands it: dynamic `*Filter` discovery and/or a
  short TTL cache keyed by instance/profile to avoid re-probing when users bounce between profiles
  pointing at the same NetBox.
- ☑ **Local cache (2026-06-19).** A small, bounded **in-memory** view-model cache (keyed by
  profile+kind+ref) so a burst of identical reads doesn't re-hit NetBox. Single short TTL (default 30s,
  a *de-dupe* window, not a freshness window — nothing is served past TTL); `r`/auto-refresh/profile-
  switch always bust; a dim "cached Ns ago" footer chip surfaces age. Shipped for TUI **detail**
  navigation; configurable via `config.toml [cache]`. An on-disk SQLite version was built then
  deliberately walked back (staleness + a large on-disk cache are the wrong trade for an infra tool).
  ☑ Settings-modal toggle for `enabled`/`ttl_secs` (hot-applied). **The CLI intentionally does NOT
  cache** — it's one-shot (resolve→print→exit), so an in-memory cache has nothing to reuse, and "always
  fresh from source" is the right default for the scripting/automation surface; no `--no-cache` /
  `nbox cache clear` (nothing persistent to bypass or clear). The cache is a long-lived-process feature.
  ☑ **MCP cache** — `nbox serve` reads (`nbox_get`) go through the cache (chatty agents re-reading the
  same object graph de-dupe within the TTL), with an `nbox_cache_clear` tool so agents can force fresh
  reads after out-of-band changes. ☑ **Preview-pane caching** — the results preview shares the detail
  cache key, so scrolling back over seen rows is instant and a preview warms the cache for opening that
  object (and vice versa). Cache is now complete across surfaces (TUI detail + preview, settings toggle,
  MCP reads + clear; CLI intentionally none). Optional follow-up: ☐ MCP `cached_at`/age annotation
  (short TTL + the clear tool already cover most of it).
- ☑ **Single binary.** One canonical full-featured binary per platform: the default feature set
  carries every cross-platform user feature (`http`, native `keyring`, `clipboard`, `updates`), no
  feature-variant artifacts. `--no-default-features` stays a dev-only lean build;
  `keyring-secret-service` (D-Bus) stays off so the musl static build links clean. Release builds derive
  the feature set from `default` (no redundant `--features` flags). MSRV dropped 1.95 → 1.88 (the 1.95
  floor was a leftover of the removed on-disk cache; stale `cache`-feature docs cleaned up).
- ☐ Batch queries from a file (audits).
- ☐ Configurable client concurrency for very large instances — `search` is a bounded fan-out and
  `list_all` is `max`-capped today; expose tuning only if a real instance needs it.
- ☐ TurboBulk export — capability-detect `/api/plugins/turbobulk/`, read/export-only (JSONL, no
  arrow/parquet dep), behind a feature flag, clean fallback when absent. Fast full-table export/audit
  on large instances where paginated REST is too slow.
- ☐ Split `prefs.toml` (runtime state) from `config.toml` (user config), per xfr. Pairs with
  `config_version`.

**Reconsidering / likely cut**

- Plugin / custom-command system — cut; a non-goal.
